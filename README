# Crunum
## What is Crunum?
Crunum(which stand for "Crunching number") is a library for Matrix and Vector,

Written entirely in C, of course,

It only supports Lua, or maybe C technically, for now.

Purpose? For fun

## Features

- Matrix and vector operation, accelerated by SIMD

## Supported Languages

- Lua, 5.4+

## How to install it
Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vgwws/crunum.git
```
Configure ir
```bash
./configure --with-target=<language>
```
Install it
```bash
make install
```
If you want to uninstall it
```bash
make uninstall
```

## Examples Code

Lua:

```lua
local crn = require("crunum") -- Import it

print("Version: ", crn.__version__) -- Print the library version

local mat1 = crn.matrix.new(10, 10) -- Make a new matrix with size 10x10

local mat2 = crn.matrix.randinit(10, 10) -- Make a new randomly generated matrix with size 10x10

print("Matrix 2: ", mat2)

mat1:set(1, 1, 2) -- Set mat1[1][1] = 2
mat1:set(1, 2, 3.4) -- Set mat1[1][2] = 3.4
mat1:set(3, 5, 90) -- Set mat1[3][5] = 90
mat1:set(10, 2, 33) -- Set mat1[3][5] = 90

print("Matrix 1: ", mat1)

print("Matrix * Matrix: ", mat1 * mat2) -- Matrix multiplication
print("Matrix * Scalar(3.5): ", mat1 * 3.5) -- Matrix multiplied by scalar
```

There are more examples in test/ folder(even though it was for test cases)
